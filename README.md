# Arbi
Arbi offers a revolutionary approach to studying by providing a centralized platform that combines education and entertainment. With a captivating plot twist, Arbi engages students from around the globe in a seamless studying experience. Unlike traditional methods, where students study solely for grades, Arbi encourages a shift in mindset by introducing the concept of earning Arbi points. By setting their sights on accumulating these points, students are naturally incentivized to dedicate more time and effort to their studies.

Recognizing the significance of physical exercise in maintaining overall well-being, Arbi incorporates a unique requirement: completing the daily arbi. This daily routine consists of a series of exercises that can be repeated until users feel satisfied with their efforts. Notably, the more exercises students perform, the greater the number of points they can earn. The daily arbi serves as an excellent means to accumulate substantial points while fostering a balanced lifestyle.

Every time users access Arbi, they are warmly greeted with the daily arbi, ensuring that this engaging and rewarding practice becomes an integral part of their study routine. With Arbi, students embark on an educational journey that seamlessly integrates the pursuit of knowledge, physical activity, and personal growth, creating a truly exceptional and immersive study experience.
  
# How to install

Arbi aims to keep installment easy and beginner friendly as possible. The process is simple. 

There are 2 versions of Arbi. 
* Basic: The basic version is Arbi with its main features, and doesn't include the science window, and learn feature.
* Full: The full version includes all of the features in Arbi; but requires you to have Adobe Acrobat Reader installed (free version works fine too). 

### Step 0. (For people trying the full version)
* Go to https://get.adobe.com/reader/ and download _Adobe Acrobat Reader DC_. It's completely free. If you already have Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, you can skip this step.
